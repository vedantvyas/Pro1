It's called swine flu because in the past, the people who caught it had direct contact with pigs. That changed several years ago, when a new virus emerged that spread among people who hadn't been near pigs.</p>

Since then, people have continued to get sick from swine flu, but not as many.</p>

Like seasonal&nbsp;flu, it can cause more serious health problems for some people. The best protection is to get a&nbsp;flu vaccine, or flu shot&nbsp;every year. Swineflu&nbsp;is one of the viruses included in the vaccine.</p>

The contageous period usually is&nbsp;one day before they have any symptoms, and as many as 7 days after they get sick. Kids can be contagious for as long as 10 days.</p>
